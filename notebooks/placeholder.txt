This folder contains the main Jupyter Notebook for the project: Cybersecurity_WebThreat_Interaction.ipynb

The notebook performs:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of AWS CloudWatch_Traffic_Web_Attack.csv dataset (282 network sessions across 7 countries)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on web traffic logs
- Feature scaling of bytes_in, bytes_out, and duration_seconds
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest to identify ~5% suspicious sessions
- Visualization of attacker IP and traffic behavior patterns

All steps are executed using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data-driven cybersecurity insights.
